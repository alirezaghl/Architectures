# Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for MNIST

A PyTorch implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) trained on the MNIST dataset using Contrastive Divergence.


This implementation includes:

* A basic RBM model with configurable architecture
* CD-k training (default k=1)
* MNIST data preprocessing
* Training visualization with reconstruction samples
* Training progress monitoring
